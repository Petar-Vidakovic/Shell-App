# deque.h

A Deque, also known as a double-ended queue, is a linear data structure that is able to add and remove elements from both ends. It can also be thought of a double-ended stack since you can push and pop elements from two ends. The Deque can also be used as a Queue. The only elements accessible from a Deque ar the two elements at its ends (front element and back element).

## Deque Implementation

This implementation uses a circular buffer (ring buffer or cyclic buffer) in order to operate on O(1) for push and pop on either ends. The only case where it takes longer than O(1) is when the buffer is reallocated. If it was implemented as a regular array, adding or removing elements from the front would take O(N) due to the need to shift all elements in the Deque.

Two indices are kept track of. The `front` index and the `rear` index. These represent the both ends of the Deque. If an index reaches one end of the real buffer, they wrap around to the other end and an element is added there. This abstracts the real buffer as a circular buffer with the cost os constantly checking for boundaries and using the modulo operator.
