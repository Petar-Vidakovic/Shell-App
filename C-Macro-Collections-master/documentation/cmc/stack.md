# stack.h

A Stack is a Last-in First-out (or First-in Last-out) data structure used in a variety of algorithms. It is a Dynamic Array that can only add or remove its elements at the end of the buffer, in this case, it represents the top of the stack.

## Stack Implementation

It has three main functions: `push` which adds an element at the top of the stack; `pop` which removes the top element from the stack; and `top` which returns the top element without removing it (it is also sometimes called `peek`).

A Stack is used in algorithms like backtracking, depth-first search, expression evaluation, syntax parsing and many more.
